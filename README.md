Human identification using gait is a biometric identification system that uses an individual’s walking pattern as a means of identification. This technique is based on the fact that everyone has a unique way of walking, determined by factors such as body size, weight, and physical structure. 

The system uses captured video footage of an individual’s gait and uses computer algorithms to analyze the movement patterns. The analysis is then compared to a database of previously recorded gait patterns to identify the individual. The use of gait as a biometric identifier has several advantages over other biometric methods such as fingerprinting and facial recognition, including the ability to identify individuals at a distance and in low-light conditions. However, there are also several challenges to implementing this technology, including the need for accurate and consistent video footage, and the potential for errors due to changes in walking patterns caused by factors such as injury or illness. Despite these challenges, the use of gait as a biometric identifier has shown promising results in research studies. It has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including security systems, law enforcement, and healthcare.

The utilization of gait features for biometric identification, particularly in determining organizational membership, represents a significant advancement in the field of biometrics. This study leverages the extensive CASIA B dataset, which encompasses a diverse range of gait data from individuals associated with different organizations, to provide valuable insights into biometric identification.

By employing sophisticated algorithms such as Isolation Forest and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), the research aims to detect similarities between an individual’s gait characteristics and those specific to the target organization. Subsequently, a powerful combination of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an XGBoost model is employed to achieve exceptional levels of accuracy in individual
identification. The experimental results highlight the model’s efficacy in accurately recognizing individuals based on their
distinct gait features. This breakthrough has far-reaching implications for security and access control systems across various domains, including law enforcement, healthcare, and transportation. By shedding light on the potential of gait analysis as a biometric identification technique, this research significantly contributes to the field and opens up new avenues for future exploration and application.

The primary objective of this research is to address the need for robust and accurate gait recognition systems using deep neural networks. This study aims to develop a state-of-the-art model for reliably identifying individuals based on their unique walking patterns, thereby enhancing safety and security in diverse environments. By harnessing the power of machine learning and deep learning techniques, the re-search endeavors to advance the field of gait recognition by developing sophisticated algorithms capable of analyzing intricate gait features. The objective is to create a system that achieves exceptional performance in accurately identifying individuals, with high precision and recall rates. To accomplish this, a comprehensive dataset of gait features is utilized to train and evaluate the proposed model, with rigorous metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall employed to assess its effectiveness. The ultimate goal is to provide a cutting-edge solution that surpasses existing gait recognition methods, making significant contributions to surveillance, law enforcement, healthcare, transportation, and access control systems. By achieving reliable and accurate identification of individuals based on their gait patterns, the research aims to enhance security measures and ensure public safety in a wide range of real-world applications
